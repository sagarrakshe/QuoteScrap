yourself, either way, or even give you permission to try "the other 
way". (Darren, 44)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Meditation creates space in 
your busy mind that often leads to insights and noticing those things 
which are actually most important. (Blaine, 49)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Being inspired comes before inspiring. (Paul, 60)</li><p></p><p></p><li>If you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all. (Matt M., 10)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Take people how you find them, not how you want them to be. (Steve H. 52)</li><p></p><p></p><li>He
 wasn't the one if he never fought for you... don't stop fighting for 
love just because he stopped fighting for you. Have the courage to 
believe in love again, and again, and again, because without it we have 
nothing. He lost all the love you have. His loss. (Taylor, 17)</li><p></p><p></p><li>No
 one but yourself controls you. No one can make the hard decisions for 
you. Those are up to you. Make the decisions you feel comfortable 
making. If you don't like something, make a decision that suits you. 
Once you make a decision, you can't change it. Make The RIGHT Choice The
 First Time. There's no second chances! (Anonymous)</li><p></p><p></p><li>We are passionate about the things that matter when everything else is taken away from us. (Stacey, 28)</li><p></p><p></p><li>The
 way to become great is to admit those things inside of you that are not
 so great and work on making them better. (Elton E., 39)</li><p></p><p></p><li>It's what you do that makes you happy, not what you have. (Shaid, 21)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I love my self. (Laisha, 39)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Sometimes friends, even best friends, can break your heart! (JD, 35)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Nobody
 was born as a murderer, prostitute, failure, bad person, u name it all.
 Circumstances and situations of life changes us but still it's up to us
 what we want to become in life. Anyone can change from bad to good even
 visa versa. Any decision u make &amp; believe in will follow, either 
good or bad. (Mmathabo, 24)</li><p></p><p></p><li>It is amazing what you can achieve when you let go of the fear, and just do it. (Michelle, 40)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never back down or lessen yourself to someone who breathes the exact same air as you do. (Joseph, 19)</li><p></p><p></p><li>When people are jealous of you, you are becoming successful. (JPM, 38)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Family is family, everything else... ISN'T.

 learned that its not over unite God says it's over, people may tell you
 it's over, the situation may tell you it's over- it will only be over 
on your death day. (Matthew O., 23)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Whatever your 
aim in life always take steps to avoid and be prepared for the exact 
opposite, but never lose site of your initial and hopefully decent 
intentions. (Anonymous, 44)</li><p></p><p></p><li>To expect is a good thing but dont expect too much that your expectations will be the reason for your failure. (Punam, 18)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I
 have begun to realize the importance of making someone else feel good; 
to go out of my way to make someone else's day; to see a person and try 
to understand what they are going through. How far we go in life all 
comes down to the level of compassion we decide to have each day. We can
 steer ourself in any direction we choose. How much different our world 
would be if we gave up all of our selfish desires and saw the value of 
human dignity. (Anna, 26)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Notice that the word family has an I Love You at the end. This is my advice, family comes first. (Mark, 35)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Stop
 worrying about what will happened in the future, doing so will prevent 
you to live the present to the fullest. (Tabatha, 34)</li><p></p><p></p><li>When all appears lost, there is always HOPE. (Jackie, 54)</li><p></p><p></p><li>It’s
 weird the older I get and the more people I meet, the more I realize 
how you should and should not talk or act towards others. Yet at the 
same time, the older I get and the more people I meet, the less I want 
to. (Marty, 39)</li><p></p><p></p><li>One of the hardest things in life 
is often the most necessary; being by yourself. If you can't help 
yourself, then how can you help others? (Travis H., 32)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Sometimes in life u realize u have to live with the hand u were dealt and learn how to win the game with it. (Amanda S. 28)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Don't be like me and lose all your knowlegde you had at 15. (Anonymous, 18)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Some things don't always have to be nice to be enjoyable. (Graeme H., 17)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Once
 you love someone, it is never the same. So dispose their friendship if 
they do not like you in return. For its alot harder to keep something 
that you know is fake, than to ditch for something that is real. (Adam, 
22)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I've learned tht your close friends so called to be can be your worst enemies. (Ametrius, 25)</li><p></p><p></p><li>In life you're meant to forgive and forget but in realitly you never forget.

 matter what age, size, or race; look pass the norm, look pass soietys 
view of the average American - you're better than that. The only way 
you'll be truly happy in this world, is by giving love to all of those 
who need it. (Brandon, 20)</li><p></p><p></p><li>NEVER sleep with someone you been with for a month, they will eventually hurt you at the end. (Stephanie, 15)</li><p></p><p></p><li>If you live your life without expectations you won't be disappointed. No expectations = no disappointments. (Roy, 63)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Love and embrace every moment of every day of your life. (Irma, 48)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I have realized that building hate and anger has spoiled only my time and not the one I hate or angry with. (Shobana, 32)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never give up. Don't let the drama bring you down. (Leonie, 16)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I've
 learned that parents are the imagery of a earthly God to their children
 so take responsiblity in making your character like Him, by reading and
 meditating in His word daily. So the Holy Spirit can come and be a 
comforter to you in your years of parenting. (Joyce, 40)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Have
 faith to know you are here for a higher purpose. God is the answer. In 
the end, it's the "dash" between the two numbers on your headstone that 
matter. Make a difference every day! (Tony, 54)</li><p></p><p></p><li>When I trust God,  everything in my life will unfold as it should. (Alena, 61)</li><p></p><p></p><li>I've learned that there are fewer absolutes than I once believed there to be. (Bill, 48)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never
 discourage your partner in bedroom, under any circumstances. It will be
 the invitation to life long misunderstanding. (Y., 64)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never argue/quarrel in front of children. (Y., 64)</li><p></p><p></p><li>You can't make anyone proud until you are proud of yourself. (Justin, 16)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never
 give up hope, never give up your aspirations and never give up your 
dreams, no matter what or who stands in your way. Because if you don't 
what you have worked so hard is lost. Always believe in your dreams. 
(Robert, 28)</li><p></p><p></p><li>The wisest person in the world knows they have a lot to learn. (Helena M., 46)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Not everyone is going to like you, however, you have to like yourself. That's what matters. (Dee, 51)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Love yourself more than others and respect yourself if you want others to respect you. (Samantha, 18)</li><p></p><p></p><li>If you can't find the strength to live your own life then you won't be happy in the end.

 to the voice of your soul and heart, don't waste the time spending on 
the lives of other people. Just be yourself, learn to follow your 
dreams, and most importantly, be positive. (Viktor C., 20)</li><p></p><p></p><li>The word love is overused, but the action isn't used enough. (Kiersten, 17)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Let past hurts go, live in the moment, but never forget about your future. (Anonymous, 20)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Always

 remember that someone still does... you. (Alexander S., 28)</li><p></p><p></p><li>True love only comes once in a life time. (Jessica, 23)</li><p></p><p></p><li>If you're not living life to the fullest, you need to move closer to the edge. (Jim &amp; Debbie, 65)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Never
 lose the kid inside you! As people get older they tend to become too 
serious and lose their silliness and playful side. Grab a balloon and a 
friend and play 'keepy up's' (don't let the balloon touch the floor!). 
If you haven't played this since you were a kid, you may feel silly, but
 that's the point. There is nothing wrong with being silly, no matter 
what age you are. (Dean, 34)</li><p></p><p></p><li>The only thing that 
is really important is love.  Look for reasons to love people, love 
yourself and be kind to yourself.  Don't look for anything in return... 
just keep loving, even when it feels futile, and the person you are 
trying to love can't seem to accept it.  Love them in spite of 
themselves. (Elaine, 53)</li><p></p><p></p><li>There is no void so empty as the loss of a friend. (Anonymous, 80)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Influence is all we have; the only person you can change is yourself. (Mike W., 55)</li><p></p><p></p><li>Sometimes
 life isn't fair no matter how hard you work or how much you sacrifice 
because there will be others who will do less than you yet get more out 
of it. Take what you can out of life and live it to the fullest. There's
 no point in waiting for something to happen when you can just enjoy it.
