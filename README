This is simple Python script which grabs a quote from the life-lessons.html page and diplays it as a notification. 
I have used Datetime module so the scripts show one quote/per day. Next day it displays the next quote.

REQUIREMENTS:

All you need is to install Mechanize and BeautifulSoup to run this script
